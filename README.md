<p align="center"><i>A recreation of the +1 Clicker Diamondfire Minigame in Paper Mc</i></p>
</p>

## What is this?
This Plugin is a recreation of the +1 clicker minigame found on diamondfire and made by DeepSeaBlue, if you have never played +1 Clicker, you should play the Diamondfire version before playing this one,
To play this in diamondfire join ***mcdiamondfire.com*** and do ***/join 42998*** and you are ready to go, quick reminder to type ***@togglemsg*** in chat as fast as possible, this will turn off prestige messages, this will save your ears.

### But why?
This was first a silly coding project to improve my coding skills, but i just kept adding stuff and well, here we are, as of right now i coded up to the Rebirth layer, this is still very little compared to the diamondfire version, but more tiers are on the work
### Yea but What is +1 clicker anyways?
+1 clicker is an incremental made in Minecraft, The game revolves around the mechanic of gaining and using +1. It is used to upgrade yourself to become stronger. Clicking allows you to gain +1 equal to the clicker level, There are over 300+ Upgrades (Counting All of them), Combat, Cosmos, Lottery, and a LOT more content, feel free to find that yourself :)

## Plans for the Game
I have a lot of **ideas** that i could add in the project, since im not limited to the diamondfire limitations i can go crazy with some things
altrough rn there are a few things to work on before i could do any of those crazy stuff
* Change a lot of the Ints in the Code into BreakInfnity.java to allow numbers beyond the 32-64 bit limit
* Rework the way Gear works so that it dosent make my code unredable
* Finish the rest of the rebirth upgrades
* Start work on Challenges (Probably code Apotheosis First)
* Fix whatever ASCII issue is happening (Thanks Fizzie for finding this out)

## Lisence
This is under the MIT lisence, soo yea, feel free to use the code, or even help me if you want, altrough idk who would want this unredable mess

## Credits
Credits go to all the lovely devs of +1 clicker for actually letting me do this
and also the community itself, i swear its not toxic (trust)
Huge Thanks to
